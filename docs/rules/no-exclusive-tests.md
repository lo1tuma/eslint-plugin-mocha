# Disallow exclusive tests (`mocha/no-exclusive-tests`)

⚠️ This rule _warns_ in the ✅ `recommended` [config](https://github.com/lo1tuma/eslint-plugin-mocha#configs).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Mocha has a feature that allows you to run tests exclusively by appending `.only` to a test-suite or a test-case.
This feature is really helpful to debug a failing test, so you don’t have to execute all of your tests.
After you have fixed your test and before committing the changes you have to remove `.only` to ensure all tests are executed on your build system.

This rule reminds you to remove `.only` from your tests by raising a warning whenever you are using the exclusivity feature.

## Rule Details

This rule looks for every `describe.only`, `it.only`, `suite.only`, `test.only`, `context.only` and `specify.only`occurrences within the source code.
Of course there are some edge-cases which can’t be detected by this rule e.g.:

```js
var describeOnly = describe.only;
describeOnly.apply(describe);
```

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
// bdd
describe.only('foo', function () {});
it.only('foo', function () {});
describe['only']('bar', function () {});
it['only']('bar', function () {});

// tdd
suite.only('foo', function () {});
test.only('foo', function () {});
suite['only']('bar', function () {});
test['only']('bar', function () {});
```

These patterns would not be considered warnings:

```js
// bdd
describe('foo', function () {});
it('foo', function () {});
describe.skip('bar', function () {});
it.skip('bar', function () {});

// tdd
suite('foo', function () {});
test('foo', function () {});
suite.skip('bar', function () {});
test.skip('bar', function () {});
```

## When Not To Use It

- If you really want to execute only one test-suite or test-case because all other tests should not be executed, turn this rule off.
- If you use another library which exposes a similar API as mocha (e.g. `describe.only`), you should turn this rule off, because it would raise warnings.
