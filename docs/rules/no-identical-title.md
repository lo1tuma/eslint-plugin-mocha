# Disallow identical titles (no-identical-title)

Having identical titles for two different tests or test suites may create confusion. For example, when a test with the same title as another test in the same test suite fails, it is harder to know which one failed and thus harder to fix.

## Rule Details

This rule looks at the title of every test and test suites. It will report when two test suites or two test cases at the same level of a test suite have the same title.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
describe('foo', function () {
    it('should do bar', function() {});
    it('should do bar', function() {}); // Has the same title as the previous test

    describe('baz', function() {
        // ...
    });

    describe('baz', function() { // Has the same title as a previous test suite
        // ...
    });
});
```

These patterns would not be considered warnings:

```js
describe('foo', function () {
    it('should do foo', function() {});
    it('should do bar', function() {});

    // Has the same name as a parent test suite, which is fine
    describe('foo', function() {
        // Has the same name as a test in a parent test suite, which is fine
        it('should do foo', function() {});
        it('should work', function() {});
    });

    describe('baz', function() { // Has the same title as a previous test suite
        // Has the same name as a test in a sibling test suite, which is fine
        it('should work', function() {});
    });
});
```
