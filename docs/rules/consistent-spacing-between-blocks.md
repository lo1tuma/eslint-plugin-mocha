# Require consistent spacing between blocks (`mocha/consistent-spacing-between-blocks`)

ðŸ’¼ This rule is enabled in the âœ… `recommended` [config](https://github.com/lo1tuma/eslint-plugin-mocha#configs).

ðŸ”§ This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

Mocha testing framework provides a structured way of writing tests using functions like `describe`, `it`, `before`, `after`, `beforeEach`, and `afterEach`. As a convention, it is very common to add some spacing between these calls. It's unfortunately also quite common that this spacing is applied inconsistently.

Example:

```js
describe('MyComponent', function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        // setup code
    });
    it('should behave correctly', function () {
        // test code
    });
    afterEach(function () {
        // teardown code
    });
});
```

In this example, there are no line breaks between Mocha function calls, making the code harder to read.

## Rule Details

This rule enforces a line break between calls to Mocha functions (before, after, describe, it, beforeEach, afterEach) within describe blocks.

The following patterns are considered errors:

```javascript
describe('MyComponent', function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        // setup code
    });
    it('should behave correctly', function () {
        // test code
    });
});
```

These patterns would not be considered errors:

```javascript
describe('MyComponent', function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        // setup code
    });

    it('should behave correctly', function () {
        // test code
    });

    afterEach(function () {
        // teardown code
    });
});
```

## When Not To Use It
